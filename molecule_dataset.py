    Dataset for supervised training of the molecule design given as a list pseudo-expert molecules.
    Each molecule is given as a dictionary with the following keys and values
          "start_atom": [int] the int representing the atom from which to start
          "action_seq": List[List[int]] Actions which need to be taken on each index to create the molecule
          "smiles": [str] Corresponding smiles string
          "obj": [float] Objective function evaluation

    Each datapoint in this dataset is a partial molecule: We sample an instance, randomly choose an index up to which
    all actions will be performed. Then, ending up at action index 0, we take the next item in the action seq
    (which corresponds to a list all actions that need to be taken from index to index) as training target.
    As the number of atoms will be different for molecules in a batch, we pad the atoms, and set all labels corresponding
    to the padded atoms to -1 (in the CE-loss, this will be specified as `ignore_index=-1`.
