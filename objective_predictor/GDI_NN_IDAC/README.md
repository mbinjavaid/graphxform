# Gibbs-Duhem-Informed Neural Networks for Binary Activity Coefficient Prediction

This is the source code for the paper **[Gibbs-Duhem-Informed Neural Networks for Binary Activity Coefficient Prediction](tba)** (preprint). 

## Overall framework structure

![Framework_structure](doc/GDNN_structure.png)

## Data & Usage

This repository contains following folders:

* **data**: acitvity coefficient dataset [1] for training the GNN and MCM [2,3]
* **doc**: documentation
* **models**: GNN and MCM model structure
* **util**: util functions

### Data

The data set of binary activity coefficient was created by Qin et al. [1]. We added created further data for validation with COSMO-RS [4,5].

### Usage

For **running** the GNN or MCM model, please install the required environment (see below) and then execute
`train.py` for training
or 
`infer.py` for inference/evaluation of the model against experimental data.
